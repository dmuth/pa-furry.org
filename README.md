<img src="./img/logo-200px.jpg" align="right" />

This is a GitHub repo tracking the documents for the website hosted at [http://www.pa-furry.org/](http://www.pa-furry.org/).


## Development Instructions

- `npm install http-server -g`
- `http-server`
- [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)
- `./go.sh` - If you're me, this will sync the current directory to the AWS S3 bucket hosting the website.  If you're not me, don't do this. :-)
   - If you're me, you also may need to invalidate the cache in CloudFront.
