Howdy!
<br/>
<br/>

It's been a fun 13 years running the Pennsylvania Furries website--I brought
it online in 2005 and ran the website until the end of the 2018.  
<br/>
<br/>

The reason for taking the website down is largely because forums have been
surpassed by other forms of communiaction such as Telegram, Twitter and Facebook,
at least in the furry community.  This is apparent by looking at
<a href="./posts.png">user posts</a> and <a href="./comments.png">user comments</a>
over the life of the website.  It also didn't helpthat
more and more spammers <a href="./user-signups.png">were signing up</a>.
<br/>
<br/>

<b>What comes next?</b>

furries and participate in the community:
